# Land-It-Rocket-3D-Game
This is a beginner friendly Unity 3d game project.  

This is a old one and one of my first projects. I wasn't going to publish it since it is pretty basic to me right now. But I figured you can use it for beginners for educational purposes.
It has:

- 3 levels
- Basic player movement
- Multiple UI Scenes such as main menu and How to Play Scene.
- Shows how to navigate through scenes
- Basic particle effects.
- Audiosource
